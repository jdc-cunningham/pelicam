I have some of my cameras on my desk at my job and I was looking at them.

Made me think of JSON you know, how nice it is to just nest things and have a structure.

I think that's how I want the menus to be defined, nested pages for the state management.

I'm going to work on this again probably near spring just so I can get out and explore, be with nature

I also want to source a better screen, like a touch screen-primaly camera with a 5D button and shutter, possibly dedicated back button
